TYPERACER HELPER
=========================

Typeracer helper is a simple Google Chrome extension that lets you play all typeracer games (except for private invite games) by simply pressing your spacebar key. All you have to do is go to the Chrome extensions page, click Load unpacked extension, and select the folder that has Typeracer Helper. This was a small weekend project and it is a little buggy! You need to refresh in between games or else it won't work, and clicking the dialogue boxes or alt-tabbing may cause the script to pause for that page.
